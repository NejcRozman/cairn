##  Overview

**Cairn** is protocol and platform that tracks the reuse and reproduction of scientific outputs in the field of embodied AI, and retroactively rewards impactful work (both scientific and supporting).
 
 > By leveraging decentralized storage, smart contracts, and tokenized impact assets, Cairn creates a transparent, incentive-aligned ecosystem for scientists, funders, and the broader research community.

## Challenges in Scientific Research

Scientific research, especially in **embodied AI**, faces systemic challenges: 

- **Poor incentives for long-term, impactful work:** \
Academic recognition and funding systems tend to reward novelty and publication volume over real-world usability, long-term impact, and reproducibility.
- **Reproducibility crisis**: \
A large portion of published research cannot be reliably reproduced, leading to wasted effort, erosion of trust, and slower scientific progress.  
- **Centralized funding**: \
Funding decisions are concentrated in a few institutions, which can limit diversity in research agendas and hinder innovation from underrepresented contributors.
<br>

> Together, these factors create a research ecosystem where reusable and impactful work is difficult to track, undervalued in funding decisions, and ultimately underutilized‚Äîslowing progress in one of the most promising and societally significant areas of artificial intelligence.

##  Our Solution

We combined established concepts with a new system (Proof of Reproducibility) designed to provide verifiable evidence for scientific experiments:

- **Proof of Reproducibility (PoR):** Verifiable, cryptographically-secured evidence that experiments have been independently reproduced. 
- **Decentralized Storage:** All research data, models, and proofs are stored on IPFS for permanence and verifiability. 
- **Smart Contracts:** Manage project registration and proof of reproducibility, impact evaluation, and funding distribution on-chain.  
- **Hypercerts:** Tokenized certificates of impact, representing the value of scientific contributions.  
- **Retroactive Funding:** Rewards are distributed based on actual impact and reproducibility, not just proposals.  
- **DAO Governance:** Community-driven evaluation and funding decisions.
<br>

The system is designed to incentivize and validate impactful, reproducible scientific research by connecting scientists, funders, and decentralized infrastructure via a Web3-native workflow. It is built around the
Cairn platform, with various stakeholders and components described below:

## Filecoin integration
Cairn integrates Filecoin technology as a foundational layer to ensure decentralized, secure, and verifiable storage of scientific research data and metadata:

- **Smart Contracts on the Filecoin Network:**  
  Cairn‚Äôs smart contract is currently deployed on the Filecoin calibration testnet.

- **Data Storage and Retrieval:**  
  All scientific research outputs‚Äîincluding datasets, machine learning models, benchmarks, and Proofs of Reproducibility (PoRs)‚Äîare stored on **IPFS**. This ensures **data provenance, immutability, and long-term availability**.

- **Crypto-based Payments with USDFC Stablecoin:**  
  Cairn uses the **USDFC stablecoin**, native to Filecoin‚Äôs ecosystem, to enable **stable, trustless, and efficient capital flows** between funders and researchers, supporting usage-based billing and retroactive funding models.

|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Storage           | **Filecoin**, **IPFS**       | Decentralized, verifiable storage of all research data and metadata |
| Payments          | **USDFC Stablecoin**         | Stable, on-chain funding and rewards                 |
| Smart Contracts   | **Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)** | Transparent, immutable project and funding logic     |
| Impact Assets     | **Hypercerts**                   | Tokenized, tradable proof of  impact       |

## How Cairn Works

Cairn provides a transparent, decentralized workflow for tracking, verifying, and rewarding impactful scientific research:

1. **Project Creation:**  
  Scientists register new research projects on-chain, minting Hypercert impact assets to represent contributions. Project metadata and outputs are stored on IPFS, with their CIDs registered on the Cairn smart contract.

2. **Recording Outputs:**  
  Models, datasets, benchmarks, and results are published to IPFS and linked to the project via smart contracts. This ensures all research outputs are verifiable and permanently available.

3. **Proof of Reproducibility (PoR):**  
  Third parties independently replicate experiments and submit cryptographically-secured PoRs‚Äîexperiment logs, video proofs, and receipts‚Äîstored on IPFS and linked on-chain. This provides verifiable evidence of reproducibility.

4. **Impact Evaluation:**  
  Designated scientists, funders, and evaluators vote on each project‚Äôs impact tier, determining eligibility for retroactive funding. Future implementations will introduce DAO-based community voting.

5. **Retroactive Funding:**  
  Once a project meets the required criteria (outputs, PoRs, impact evaluation), USDFC funds are distributed proportionally to impact-asset holders based on verified impact.

**Dispute Resolution:**  
Community members can challenge submitted PoRs through a dispute mechanism, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of reproducibility claims.
