## Usage 
- Register project:
    - Use the `useRegisterProject` hook to register a new project with a name and description.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add your environment variables:
    ```env
    VITE_AGENT_KEY=xxxxx
    VITE_PROOF=xxxxx
    ```
    Replace `xxxxx` with your actual values. To see how to get these values, refer to the [w3up-client docs](https://docs.storacha.network/)
2. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash

### Quick Start
This is meant to be a quick start guide for users who want to quickly try out the Cairn protocol and platform.

#### Wallet Setup
1. **Install MetaMask**:  
   Download and install the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/).
2. **Create a Wallet**:
    Follow the instructions to create a new wallet. Make sure to securely store your seed phrase.
3. **Connect to Filecoin Calibration Testnet**:
    - **Cairn app should prompt the user with correct chain data**
    - If not, you can manually add the network:
      - Open MetaMask and click on the network dropdown.
      - Select "Add Network" and enter the following details:
        - **Network Name**: Filecoin Calibration Testnet
        - **New RPC URL**: https://rpc.ankr.com/filecoin_testnet
        - Other data should be filled automatically.
#### Getting Testnet tFIL and USDFC
1. **Get tFIL**:  
   Use the [Filecoin Calibration Faucet](https://faucet.calibnet.chainsafe-fil.io/) to request testnet FIL (tFIL) for gas fees.
2. **Get USDFC**:
    Use the [USDFC Faucet](https://forest-explorer.chainsafe.dev/faucet/calibnet_usdfc) to request USDFC tokens for funding projects.

#### Submiting a Proof of Reproducibility
Before you can register a project, you need to submit a minimum of one Proof of Reproducibility (PoR) and that PoR need to get verified. The demo app takes 5 minutes.

To submit a PoR, you need to select a project with a register output
